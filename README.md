The main aim of this project is to develop an intelligent deep learning-based system that can accurately classify Brain MRI images into different categories of diseases or normal conditions.
This system aims to assist medical professionals by providing automated detection and early diagnosis of brain abnormalities such as tumors, enhancing the accuracy and speed of the diagnostic process.
The project combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures (ANN, RNN) with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to enable visualization of MRI results, performance metrics, and model insights like accuracy and loss graphs.
Through this project, the goal is to:
Reduce manual diagnostic errors in brain MRI image interpretation.
Provide a reliable and automated solution for classifying MRI images.
Demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis.
Build a GUI-based system that simplifies model usage for non-technical users such as doctors or researchers.
Contribute towards computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that improve healthcare decision-making.
